libmrhevdata
============

The libmrhevdata library is used to convert default event structures to data 
structs and data structs to event structures.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
service development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to use the library
for easier event interaction as well as library developers wishing to improve 
on the libmrh source.
