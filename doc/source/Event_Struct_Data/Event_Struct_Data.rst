Event Struct Data
=================
The library provides event data structs for known event types. Listed here 
are all event structs for event data.

Please note that there are no structs for events without event data. 
Most events use a shared structure.

System Event Data Structs
-------------------------
.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  MRH_EvD_Sys_ResetRequest_U <../Structs/libmrhevdata_Directory/Version/1/MRH_EvSystem_V1/MRH_EvD_Sys_ResetRequest_U_t>
